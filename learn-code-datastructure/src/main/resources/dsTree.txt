Level Order Binary Tree Traversal
->Level order traversal of a tree is breadth first traversal for the tree.
        Method 1 (Use function to print a given level)
                -->Time complexity= O(n^2)
                -->space complexity= O(n)
        Method 2 (Use queue to store level data and print)

Calculate height of Binary Tree using Inorder and Level Order Traversal

Given Inorder traversal and Level Order traversal of a Binary Tree. The task is to calculate the height of the tree without constructing it.
Input : Input: Two arrays that represent Inorder
       and level order traversals of a
       Binary Tree
       in[]    = {4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 22};
       level[] = {20, 8, 22, 4, 12, 10, 14};
Output : 4

        20
        / \
        8 22
       / \
      4   12
         /  \
        10  14
